# [dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/)

My blog.

`markdown/` contains the source files, `docs/` contains the output HTML. I would call it something different, but Github Pages only let you deploy from either the root or `docs/`, and I got tired of all the output HTML cluttering up the root, so `docs/` it is.

Otherwise it's the same setup as the [site root's repository](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/dragoncoder047.github.io).
