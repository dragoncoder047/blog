Title: Dumb School Chromebooks
Date: 2022-4-1

I am a high school student, and so while I am at school I have to use the school-provided computers. The school, cheapskates they are, chose to give us Chromebooks. And anyone who needs to do some serious coding (like me) knows that Chromebooks are utterly useless.

Thankfully I have access to the GitHub Web Editor (which I am now using), so that takes away some of the hassle. But the biggest concern still remains: The school IT administrator has practically locked down our Chromebooks so that we can't do anything useful with what little processing power these ancient devices have. They have force-installed Chrome extensions (GoGuardian) that I have seen lawyers online [categorize as *spyware*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-28/how-goguardian-ai-spyware-took-over-schools-student-devices-during-covid). They have forced us to go behind a proxy -- which, for example, blocks www.processing.org because it categorizes it as "freeware/shareware" (despite Processing being used by my 8th grade computer science class), blocks www.conwaylife.com as "Games" (which it is not, it is a serious academic discussion and research site), and even blocks the Wikipedia page on amateur radio because it has the keyword of "amateur" in the URL (which is just dumb) -- and, it blocks countless other sites *simply because they are "not rated"*.

And if that's not enough, here's the kicker: They have disabled the Chome developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I), so I have no idea what's going wrong when my code crashes or hangs. I can't use the debugger. I can't see the output of `:::js console.log` calls. I can't test functions. All I can do is *hope it works* and there's nothing I can do about it.

So I have to wait until I get home and there's no such indiscrimnate censoring on my own computer.

Oh well. Sorry for the rant.

I just can't get over how much the school admins try to spoil our fun.
