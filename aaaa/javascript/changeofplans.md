Title: Change of Plans

After several days trying to debug the horribly bug-ridden `local-echo` package for xterm.js, I have had enough. It's Ioannis' responsibility to debug his package. I am switching over to another Javascript terminal ptogram I found, [jquery.terminal](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal) by Jakub T. Jankiewicz. It has built-in readline support, and well documented, so I doubt I wil have any issues. And on a side note, it natively supports syntax highliting using Prism.js, which I am already using on my blog here.  Maybe I can write a Phoo grammar for Prism.js and have built-in syntax highliting!

We'll see how it turns out.
