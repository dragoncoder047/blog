Today I am pleased to announce that you can now run Quackery online:

After a couple of false starts with Transcrypt and Brython, I have managed to set up Pyodide to run Quackery on the browser. It's still a little buggy, so please [report any errors](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/QuackeryFork/issues) when the occur.

Happy Quackerying!
