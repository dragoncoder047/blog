Title: New Site!

Status: draft

A few months ago I stumbled upon two old 1990s-era Armdroid 1000s in the back of my engineering teacher's storage closet. Naturally, being someone interested in robotics, I wanted to see if I could get them to operate.

Unfortunately, I didn't know diddlysquat about how they worked. So I did a lot of research and found the Internet's coverage of this simple robot was pretty sparse and scattered.

So today I am launching a new site that curates everything I have found along with my own photographs into one central resource which will hold any thing I discover or write pertaining to the Armdroid 1000.

You can see it here: <https://dragoncoder047.github.io/armdroid/>
