    <p>Over winter break I was able to get some more progress done building circuits to get closer to an upgrade of my old, broken Roboraptor. There are a zillion different components to this project, and I wanted to test each separately to make sure they work before I make a final board so I don&rsquo;t waste any effort or money.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve managed to do so far is less than half of what I need to do to get this whole thing where I want it in the end, but at least it&rsquo;s more than I expected I would be able to do in only a week.</p>
<p>The Roboraptor&rsquo;s internal circuit board is nicely labelled on the silkscreen, and so after a bit of poking around in the head to find which power rail the other components connected to I was able to interface my ESP32 into all of the sensors around my Roboraptor pretty easily as if they were just bare components.</p>
<h2 id="infrared-system">Infrared system</h2>
<p>The original Roboraptor came with an infrared remote and a crude object-detection system, also using infrared. If I was going to be able to use the original remote with my upgraded Roboraptor, I would have to figure out how to decode that protocol.</p>
<p>David Conran wrote a <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266">nice IR encoding/decoding protocol library</a>, and I immediately tried it out. Unfortunately, the protocol registered as <code>UNKNOWN</code>, so I couldn&rsquo;t re-transmit any of the codes, save for sending the raw timing capture array, which should have worked except I wired up the IR LED&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/issues/1938">discussion</a> with David, he <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/pull/1939">added support</a> for the Roboraptor&rsquo;s protocol based on my raw capture arrays. After some rewiring I was successfully able to receive the remote&rsquo;s codes, and then re-transmit them and fool the Roboraptor&rsquo;s circuit board into thinking I had pressed a button on the remote. I was giddy with excitement after that worked so spectacularly. The codes I captured I saved in a <a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/issues/1938#issuecomment-1367968228">table in that issue</a> for future reference.</p>
<h2 id="audio-output">Audio output</h2>
<p>The original Roboraptor used a specialized blob-of-epoxy sound IC and a one-transistor amplifier to play the sound effects. It was pretty crappy audio quality and I knew I could do better. I bought a MAX98357A amplifier from Sparkfun earlier and procrastinated testing it, but when I finally got around to it yesterday, it worked like a charm &ndash; until I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to wire it like it is supposed to.</p>
<p>The MAX98357A is a double-ended amplifier which uses two half-H bridges to alternately pull the speaker pins high and low, creating the alternating audio signal. Unfortunately, one end of the Roboraptor&rsquo;s speaker is permanently wired to the power supply rail, making it single-ended. I didn&rsquo;t want to cause a short circuit when the amplifier tries to pull that pin low, but I also didn&rsquo;t want to fuss around with re-wiring the head any more than I am already going to need to, so I got creative.</p>
<p>Having built a few audio amplifier circuits using the single-ended LM386 in the past, I tried a similar arrangement to those. I connected one end of the speaker to the supply rail like it would be, and the other end, through a large capacitor, to the positive output of the MAX98357A. Unfortunately, this severely reduced the output volume. I might not need the capacitor, but then I fear the audio quality would go down because the resulting setup would be eerily similar to the awful one-transistor amplifier in the original Roboraptor. I&rsquo;ll fiddle with it and get something to work.</p>
<h2 id="microphones">Microphones</h2>
<p>The Roboraptor had two small electret microphones positioned in the &ldquo;ears&rdquo;, and these fed into a simple peak-detector circuit that was really only good for detecting claps and other loud, sharp noises. Instead of limiting myself in hardware, I decided I would just connect the audio signal directly to my ESP32 and let it handle the feature detection in software.</p>
<p>Electret microphones require a preamplifier, so I Googled around for preamplifiers and found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Electret-Mic-Preamp/">this instructable</a>, and luckily I had most of the parts on-hand. I built it with a fixed gain of 100, instead of the variable resistor to adjust the gain, used a 1000pF coupling capacitor instead of 0.1&micro;F, and omitted the low-pass filters for testing purposes. But overall, it appeared to work decently. I printed the result to the Arduino serial plotter (turning it into an oscilloscope) and I was clearly seeing a periodic audio wave in the monitor above the noise floor when I whistled into the microphone.</p>
<p>Using a standalone electret microphone I saved out of a broken intercom system produced a lot better results that the Roboraptor&rsquo;s internal microphones, but at least the result was noticeable above the noise. Maybe some low-pass filtering would smooth the noise out. I&rsquo;ll have to fiddle with it &ndash; as with everything else &ndash; until it works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, folks. I wish I could get more done, but there aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day for that kind of work. See you in 2023.</p>
