...Gosh, I just realized that I haven't posted anything in weeks. I really don't want to fall prey to the obsession of posting everything online. I hope I'm not.

Anyway, I just finished up the first draft of the documentation of Phoo. The generator script is Python (not Phoo, shame on me) and the output is pretty primitive, at least compared to this site here.

Phoo itself seems to work okay, although there are a few bugs, including that macros are impossible, they just don't work properly ([#6](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/phoo/issues/6)), plus I have a huge laundry list of libraries I want to add to Phoo ([#9](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/phoo/issues/9)).

Oh well. Suffice to say I have other ideas I should be working and not hemming and hawing about unecessary libraries that do nothing but get me closer to fufilling [Zawinski's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski's_Law).

Here's the current version of Phoo, embedded:
