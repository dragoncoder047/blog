Series: aelith-game

For some projects I kind of want to finish it and then publish the source code. A lot of other people feel the same way. Not having the entire internet watching your programming fumbles in real time is probably a good thing -- but keeping it private also feels like you're holding it hostage from your friends and any potential collaborators.

So I've decided to make the source code for Aelith public now, rather than release it only when Aelith is finished (and I still don't have any idea how long it will take me to finish it).

You can find it on Github: <https://github.com/dragoncoder047/aelith>

Suppose Aelith winds up as another casualty of my never-ending graveyard of projects I don't ever end up finishing. With the existing code being public, then maybe someone else can fork Aelith and finish it in the way I intended, or even a new direction that I hadn't thought of.

Of course, I don't ever plan on abandoning Aelith. I have a concrete 1.0 marker in terms of content, so I know what I'm working towards, rather than any of my other projects' abstract goal of "finish this," where the meaning of "finished" can change on a whim. I've finished Aelith's plot in its entirety, to the place where I feel it would make an engaging game. (I'm not linking it here, so you can't accidentally spoil the story for yourself, if you are reading this later after Aelith releases and you want to play the game.) I don't have all of the sprites made, but I have a general idea of how they should look as I have a few made already. The sound effects are about at the same progress level.

And whether or not Aelith takes off and grows a large follwing or not, I still hope that the few who find it enjoy playing it at least half as much as I enjoy making it. To that end, I set up a Discord server for Aelith. If you're at all interested in Aelith, want to take part in developing it, or contribute in any way, I highly encourage you to join it.
