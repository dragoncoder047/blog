Phoo fried my brain.

My first programming language has just gotten way too complicated for me to maintain. I still haven't found the bug in the shell. And in the process of debugging it, I may have caused more bugs, too. Argh!

It's compounded by the fact that Phoo is a homoiconic concatenative object-oriented programming language, which is just about the most confusing possible combination of programming paradigms. I was raised on Python and Javascript, where terms like "point-free form" and "work stack" are rare or nonexistent.

So I am going to be shelving Phoo indefinitely in favor of other projects. I now have a new idea for another newer, better, and easier to understand programming language (PICKLE), and I don't need to write it in C because I found a better option for a microcontroller. I have several other ideas besides that which I'd like to try implementing, too.

So, as much as I enjoyed developing Phoo, I am not going to return to developing it anytime soon. If you are interested in Phoo, feel free to fork the Phoo repository (<https://github.com/dragoncoder047/phoo>) and add whatever you like (and if you fix bugs, *please* send me a pull request!!).

Goodbye, Phoo. Hopefully someone else will find you.
