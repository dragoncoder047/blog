Title: Gah... I broke it!
Date: 2022-06-13

Last time I had just announced that Phoo was finished. Well, it's still finished --- except for the fact that the online console no longer works. I tried porting the shell code to Phoo, but that ended up breaking the shell!

It was pretty much a line-for-line translation, so I really don't know what went wrong. I hope I can get it fixed, but at least Phoo itself works. I have more ideas, and I should probably be working on those instead.
