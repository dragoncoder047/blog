Title: Airdrop for non-Apple users
Date: 2022-3-23

It has come up often where I have a file on my parent's Mac that I need to send to my computer. Any Apple user would probably just use Airdrop. But I use Linux!... So I created a little Python script that allows sending files between computers with the only condition is one must be able to run Python and the other must have a web browser.

Here's the github gist: <https://gist.github.com/dragoncoder047/d8a983552c25d6d1aca7cef8a070db58>

Enjoy!
